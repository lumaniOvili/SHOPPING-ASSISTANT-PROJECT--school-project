The Shopping Assistant offers a comprehensive solution to address the
difficulties people encounter when managing their shopping needs. The application seeks to
address common problems with forgetfulness, visibility into inventory, and challenges
locating particular products in stores. 

This project was done under the supervision of a Professor with prior knowledge of the Agile methodology.
This class introduced me and my team members to the world of System analysis and how Agile is most preferred over the waterfall.
The team already has prior knowledge on how to design a system however is was necessary for us to learn how to analyze  a system, gathering the necessary information prior to designing a software.
We were taught all the necesary information concerning Agile as well as some softwares we could use as a team to prioritize the the Agile methodology. 
This project is the practical experience we gained from the class and I believe I am more than capable to replicate said experience as well as build on it.
